~s cse112-wm.s21: Instructions for grading

-----------------------------------------------------------------

General information:

NOTE:  Graders must stay within the time budget for each
project as listed in the emailed instructions to grade.
Students cannot work more than 220 hours per quarter, 20 hours
per week, or 8 hours per day, all campus jobs combined, during
the academic year.

If at any time a grader has a question about grading, please
email me AND the TAs, and the other graders.  Either I or
the TA in charge of a particular lab/asg will respond to all
course staff.  You probably want to set up an email alias
inside your emailer to make this task easier.

Better yet, just do a REPLYALL to the email from me or a TA
instructing you to do the grading.  Reply to that message,
not to this one, so that the SUBJECT heading is correct.
TAs:  always reply to such questions including other TAs,
all graders, and me.

Instructions for grading (cse112-wm.s21):

Read about the details in
/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cse112-wm/Assignments/
https://www2.ucsc.edu/courses/cse112-wm/:/Assignments/

Log into unix.ucsc.edu.
All grading must be done via ssh unix.ucsc.edu.

Check who to grade:
cd /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/class/cse112-wm.s21/.admin/.graders
./scorecheck.perl
This will make a list of who you are assigned to grade.
There are two kinds of output lines for individuals:

asg1/student1/SCORE    :no SCORE file: grader1
says that grader1 has not yet started on student1, who has
no partner.

asg1/student2/SCORE     :no SCORE file: grader2  pair=student3
says that grader2 must grade student2 in the usual way, then
assign the same grade to student3.  This is done with a symlink.
After grading student2:
   cd ../student3
   ln -s ../student2/SCORE
   ls -la should show a symlink SCORE -> ../student2/SCORE

cd /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/class/cse112-wm.s21/.admin/asg1 will
get you to the students' directories.  cd into one of their
usenames is where the grading actually is done.  Ignore the
subdirectory .revisions

To grade in the student's directory:
   cp ../.score/* .

Run the scripts mk.build and mk.tests or other scripts in
the directory in order to build and test the students work.
Then study the student's submitted work and output from the
programs.

Determine if the student is doing pair programming, and if so,
fill in the form SCORE.pair.  Then transfer either TOTAL1 or
TOTAL2 to the SCORE file.

Then look at the SCORE file.  After every line like:
   (3)  Some comment or other about submitted work
if they have satisfied the requirements, do nothing on that
line.  If there is a problem, immediately below that line,
write a negative number for points deducted and write a brief
(1 or 2 line) reason for deducting points.

When grading for a student is done, use ls -la to check for
large files.  If any large files are found, delete them and
make a note in SCORE.  A student with an infinite loop could
fill up the entire volume, causing an emergency panic among
student trying to submit the next program.

Make sure the SCORE file has a line with TOTALSCORE= followed
on that line by digits.  For example

TOTALSCORE=45

Specifically, there should be no characters on the line other
than TOTALSCORE= followed by a single number.  When all grading
is done, rerun cd .admin/.graders and run ./scorecheck.perl
to verify that your work is complete.

When grading is complete, graders may not change scores.
Only TAs may change scores if students complain.  Students will
be informed of their scores and all grading complaints should go
from students to one or other TA.  If a grader gets a complaint
from a student, please forward it to me and to the TAs.

To verify that you have completed the grading, again run
scorecheck.perl to see if the script has all of your scores
in the appropriate SCORE files.
