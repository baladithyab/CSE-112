<----------------------------------------------------------->
We apologize for the awkward spacing and inconsistetly-spaced
documentation that occurs in the mbir.scm. We initially wrote 
and documented mbir.scm without the 72 character/line limit,
resulting in some messy code. We will keep the character limit
in mind during future assignments in order to make the code 
more legible. Again, we apologize for the inconvenience and 
very much appreciate your understanding. Thank you!
